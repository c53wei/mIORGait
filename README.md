# mIORGait

Welcome to a trial run in website creation! This is a side-project inspired by an undergraduate research assitantship I am currently completing with
one of University of Waterloo's [humanoid robotics labs](https://uwaterloo.ca/cerc-human-centred-robotics-machine-intelligence/)ðŸ¤–

## About

The purpose is to create an interactive motion sensor marker webpage based on the [Instituti Ortopedici Rizzoli (IOR) setup](http://qfl.qualisys.com/download/qcs/IOR_Marker_Set_Full_Body.pdf). This would act as a more 'clickable' configuration interface for any future experiments that deviate from exisiting models and ideally an output (PDF probably) with both marker location figures and description could be exported.
